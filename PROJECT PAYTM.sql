/*Item_Price: This column typically represents the price at which the item is sold to the customer. It's the price that customers pay for the product. Therefore, if you're interested in revenue generated from sales, the "Item_Price" column would be directly related.

Cost_Price: This column represents the cost incurred by the seller to acquire the product. It's the price at which the seller buys the product. While it's not directly related to sales, understanding the cost price is crucial for calculating profit margins and assessing the profitability of sales.

Paid_pr: This column might represent the price paid by the seller to the supplier or manufacturer for the product. It could be similar to the "Cost_Price" but may include additional costs or considerations. Like the "Cost_Price", it's not directly related to sales but is important for understanding profitability.

In most cases, when referring to "sales", you're interested in the revenue generated from selling products, so the "Item_Price" column would be the most directly related to sales. However, understanding the cost price (either "Cost_Price" or "Paid_pr") is crucial for calculating profit margins and assessing the overall profitability of sales.*/



/* Here, we define a CTE named TotalSales.
The TotalSales CTE calculates the total sales amount across all categories using the SUM(Item_Price) aggregation function applied to the Item_Price column of the table YourTableName.
The result of this subquery is stored in the total column within the CTE.
In the main query, we select the following columns:
Category: This column represents the category of products.
SUM(Item_Price) AS Category_Total_Sales: This calculates the total sales amount for each category by summing up the Item_Price column.
(SUM(Item_Price) / (SELECT total FROM TotalSales)) * 100 AS Percentage_Contribution: This calculates the percentage contribution of each category to the overall total sales.
It divides the total sales for each category (SUM(Item_Price)) by the total sales amount obtained from the TotalSales CTE ((SELECT total FROM TotalSales)).
Then, it multiplies the result by 100 to get the percentage value.
FROM YourTableName: This specifies the table from which the data is being retrieved.
GROUP BY Category: This groups the results by the Category column.
Overall, the query calculates the total sales for each category, calculates the overall total sales using a CTE, and then computes the percentage contribution of each category to the overall total sales.
*/
/*We use the MOD() function to calculate the remainder of the division of the order number (S.no) by 12. This effectively assigns each order to a month based on its order number.
The FLOOR() function rounds down the result of the division to the nearest integer.
We add 1 to ensure that the months are numbered from 1 to 12.
The results are grouped by the calculated month.
We order the results by the total sales revenue in descending order using ORDER BY.
Finally, we limit the result to only the first row using LIMIT 1, which gives us the month with the highest total sales revenue.
Please note that this approach assumes a uniform distribution of orders across months, which may not be accurate. If possible, it's always best to have a date column in your dataset to perform time-based analyses accurately.*/
